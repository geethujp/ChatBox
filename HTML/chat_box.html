                If you want to learn how to get the most out of your life, there isn't a much better teacher than Steve Jobs, who appeared to pack several lifetimes, never mind several careers, into his 56 years on our planet. And though Jobs did not discuss his life or his unconventional choices in public all that often, one notable exception was his commencement speech to Stanford's 2005 graduating class, where he laid out his philosophy as lessons anyone can follow.1. Follow your heart and trust that it knows where it's going.
                Six months into his first year at Reed College, Jobs dropped out-a very big deal, since his biological mother had made college education a requirement of his adoption, and his adoptive parents had saved for years so he could go.
                "I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out," Jobs said. "And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made."
                He wasn't officially a student, but Jobs stuck around, dropping all his required courses and dropping in on the ones that interested him. One of those was a calligraphy course that explored different fonts, variable space between letters and so on. Jobs was drawn to this class so he took it, even though it was clearly useless for any future career he might pursue.
                Except it wasn't. "Ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me," he said. "And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography." Typography that, as Jobs pointed out, Windows and every other operating system simply copied.
                "Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward ten years later," Jobs said. "So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something-your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."
